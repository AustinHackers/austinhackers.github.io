# CVE-2023-0668: Wireshark IEEE-C37.118 parsing buffer overflow

[AHA!] has discovered an issue with [Wireshark] from The Wireshark Foundation, and is issuing this disclosure in accordance with AHA!'s standard [disclosure policy] today, on Monday, June 5, 2023. [CVE-2023-0668] has been assigned to this issue.

# Executive Summary

Due to failure in validating the length provided by an attacker-crafted [IEEE-C37.118](https://wiki.wireshark.org/IEEE-C37.118.md) packet, Wireshark version 4.0.5 and prior, by default, is susceptible to a heap-based buffer overflow, and possibly code execution in the context of the process running Wireshark. [CVE-2023-0668] appears to be an instance of [CWE-125].

# Technical Details

This crash is caused by an out of bounds read from the global buffer `conf_phasor_type`

** Note the below array contains 17 items

`wireshark/epan/dissectors/packet-synphasor.c`
```
 363 static const value_string conf_phasor_type[] = {               
 364         { 0, "Voltage, Zero sequence"           },
 365         { 1, "Voltage, Positive sequence"       },
 366         { 2, "Voltage, Negative sequence"       },
 367         { 3, "Voltage, Reserved"                },                
 368         { 4, "Voltage, Phase A"                 },                
 369         { 5, "Voltage, Phase B"                 },
 370         { 6, "Voltage, Phase C"                 },
 371         { 7, "Voltage, Reserved"                },
 372         { 8, "Current, Zero sequence"           },
 373         { 9, "Current, Positive sequence"       },
 374         { 10, "Current, Negative sequence"      },
 375         { 11, "Current, Reserved"               },
 376         { 12, "Current, Phase A"                },
 377         { 13, "Current, Phase B"                },
 378         { 14, "Current, Phase C"                },
 379         { 15, "Current, Reserved"               },
 380         {  0, NULL                              }
 381 };
```


In `dissect_PHSCALE` (which can be found in the top frame of the stack trace.) on line 1214, the `tvb_get_guint8` function is used to retrieve 1 byte from the synphasor packet payload, and then uses that value as an index into the `conf_phasor_type` array without performing any bounds checks.

`wireshark/epan/dissectors/packet-synphasor.c`

```
1190 static gint dissect_PHSCALE(tvbuff_t *tvb, proto_tree *tree, gint offset, gint cnt)

1214                                                                conf_phasor_type[tvb_get_guint8(tvb, offset + 2)].strptr);
1215         
1216                 /* first and second bytes - phasor modification flags*/
1217                 phasor_flag1_tree = proto_tree_add_subtree_format(data_flag_tree, tvb, offset, 2, ett_conf_phmod_flags,

# Attacker Value

By providing this poisoned IEEE C37.118 packet, an attacker could hijack the user account of an analyst running Wireshark. Many security appliances capture packets as a matter of course for later analysis, and Wireshark is a common tool used by incident responders. So, it would be trivial for an attacker to intentionally "get caught" in order to provide their malicious packet to an incident response analyst. Once compromised, this can provide an attacker a unique, privileged position in the targeted network.
