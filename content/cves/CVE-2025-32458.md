# CVE-2025-32458: ON Semiconductor Quantenna router_command.sh get_syslog_from_qtn Argument Injection

[AHA!] has discovered an issue with Quantenna Wi-Fi chips from ON Semiconductor, and is issuing this disclosure in accordance with AHA!'s standard [disclosure policy] on June 8, 2025. [CVE-2025-32458] has been assigned to this issue.

Any questions about this disclosure should be directed to cve@takeonme.org.

# Executive Summary

Quantenna Wi-Fi chips ship with a local control script that is vulnerable to command injection. This is an instance of [CWE-88](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/88.html), "Improper Neutralization of Argument Delimiters in a Command ('Argument Injection')," and is estimated as a CVSS [7.7](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3-1#CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N).

# Technical Details

The get_syslog_from_qtn function of the router_command.sh script is vulnerable to command injection. Observe the following code snippet:

```if [ "$1" == "get_syslog_from_qtn" ] ; then
        logmsg -t time `uptime`
        logmsg -t time `date`
        tftp -p $2 -r syslog.qtn -l /tmp/syslog.log
fi
```

There is no sanitization on the second argument, allowing an attacker to put any command they want in there and it will run. An example of remote exploitation of this vulnerability would be to use the qcsapi rpc service to run the run_script command on the router_command.sh script as follows:

```
qcsapi_sockrpc run_script router_command.sh get_syslog_from_qtn "1;/usr/sbin/inetd$IFS#"
```

This would cause a telnet service to spawn on the affected chip, but the command could be anything and would run as root.

# Attacker Value

Assuming the implementor of the Quantenna Wi-Fi chip has failed to disable the qcsapi rpc service in their end product, an attacker can use this vulnerability to run any command as root, noting especially the ability to enable the telnet service (and thus, chaining this issue with the issue described in [CVE-2025-3461]). This, in turn, can allow the attacker to essentially take complete control of the Quantenna Wi-Fi chip remotely, without authentication.

Note that it may be tricky to identify what end products incorporate this chipset. If you're aware of this chipset in use in your Wi-Fi access point, please feel free to share, as end-users are unlikely to be capable of working around this issue on their own.
