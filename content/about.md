## Who we are

The Austin Hackers Association is a loose group of hackers and
security professionals in the Austin, Texas area. We have monthly [meetings](meetings) that do have [rules](rules). We also occasionally eat sushi, BBQ, Tacos, and drink beer together.

## Our Meetings

The meetings consist of short "turbo-talks" from anyone that would like
to speak on a topic for anywhere from 5 to 10 minutes. There is a projector
and screen (HDMI only) if you wish to use a slide deck or perform demos.

- For time/location of meetings please see our [Meetings](meetings)
  page.
- Before attending, please see the [Rules](rules) page

> **If this is your first time, come prepared to speak. Continued failure to present
> will result in being removed from the venue.**

## Participation

Participation is mandatory for continued membership in the group. What
this means is that to retain a subscription to the mailing list and
to be allowed entrance to the meetings, you must contribute to the group
in some form. The best way to do this is to attend the meetings and **speak**
about what you're working on, what you're up to, etc.

### Presentation Ideas

The scariest thing for most people is trying to figure out what to
present on at AHA! While this may seem challenging, it's actually quite
easy. We have some basic suggestions that may help you:

- Present your own material/work
- We love code, demos, and live examples of work. But make it your own.
  Don't give us a 101 on a topic that any of us could just lookup
  ourselves or read an already written how-to on.
- It doesn't have to be finished work.
- If you've shown you're doing your own research but are stuck, come
  talk to us and we'll likely be able to help!
- No book reports.
- Don't tell us all about someone else's research that you read and now
  are regurgitating to us. Expand on it! Add to it!

Lastly, many of the best AHA! presentations were written one hour before
the meeting, or onsite during other speakers. We don't need or want overly
complicated powerpoint slides.

## Out of Town

If you are from out of town, showing up to a meeting when you happen
to be in town and then continuing to participate in discussions on the
email list/IRC _may_ (but not always) be considered sufficient. If you are
**NOT** from out of town, you will be held to a higher standard... likely being
expected to speak at the meetings at least every other meeting that you attend
or so.

Simply showing up to the meetings and hiding in the shadows or lurking
on IRC is definitely **NOT** a sufficient level of participation.
