generally emulating the turbo-talk style meeting format and attempting
to conform to an exclamation acronym of some form:

- [BAHA!][BAHA] Bay Area Hackers Association
- [CSHA][CSHA] - Colorado Springs Hackers Anonymous
- [DHA][DHA] - Dallas Hackers Association
- [HAHA!][HAHA] - Houston Area Hackers Anonymous

- [TWH][TWH] - The Woodlands Hacker Association
- [CHA-HA][CHA-HA] - Charlotte Hackers Anonymous
- SHA0 - Seattle Hackers Anonymous

Please note that we do not have direct affiliation to these groups and
they may operate under their own rules and policies. Please review their
websites for additional information.
