      <b>INTRO TALKS</b>
      <p>
      The purpose of an <i>intro talk</i> is to introduce yourself to the group and allow us to get an idea of your interests and self. It is meant to enable discussion with you after the meeting and allow others to get to know you a little more quickly.
      <p>
      This is a very important thing to us. The more you put into it, the more you will get out of it. <b>Don't just give us your name and walk away</b>.
      <p>
        Suggested prompts:
        <ul>
          <li>What are your interests in security or technology?</li>
          <li>Are you doing any existing projects at the moment?</li>
          <li>If you're not in security currently, what area would you like to be in?</li>
          <li>How did you learn about AHA?</li>
          <li>Do you know any current or past members?</li>
          <li>What is your mother's maiden name?</li>
        </ul>
      <p>
        Intro talks will be given in-between our regular/full talks. ONE PERSON will come up to the mic at a time to give their intro. Then we will move forward with a full talk.
