While traditionally the best way to communicate in AHA was the [mailing
list](mailinglist), now the most common place to find us
is on chat. We can be found via a number of private or invite services.

### Discord (public'ish)
* Invite: [discord.gg/yMvbvst](https://discord.gg/yMvbvst)
* Channel: aha-public
* AHA! Members should ask for role to access aha-private
* Note: This is a shared server and contains members of [Our Spawn](ourspawn)

### IRC (private)
* Server: irc.libera.chat:6697 (SSL)
* Channel: #AHA
* Channel key required

Please read and follow the server rules. Do not ask stupid questions like, "How
do I hack X" or showing up to simply cause drama. This is a good place to talk
to speakers from past meetings about their projects, or to look for feedback on
your own talk.

## FAQ

* All of the above chat methods are linked together. However, the public channel
on Discord (#aha-public) is isolated from the IRC and Slack. There is a private
members channel (#aha-private) that is bridged from Discord. Only members will be
granted access.

**How do I gain membership?**

1. Speak at a [meeting](meetings) and socialize.
2. Ask in #aha-public on Discord for member roles, if you've met the
qualifications

**How do I get an AHA hostcloak on IRC?**

* Libre's allocation of cloaks is a slow process. You probably won't.

Anything that deserves a longer conversation, planning, or feedback from
more members, should probably be taken to the [mailing list](mailinglist).
