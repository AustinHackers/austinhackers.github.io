This github repository contains the [website](http://takeonme.org) for the Austin Hackers Anonymous group. Someone should really update it to make it suck less.

## Local Dev

If you want to make changes and actually test them locally you will need to [install Hugo](https://gohugo.io/installation/). How you accomplish that is beyond this README file. We recommend using Homebrew.

```sh
hugo server
```

This will launch a local web server running on <http://127.0.0.1:1313/> that auto-updates the test site live when changes are detected on disk.
