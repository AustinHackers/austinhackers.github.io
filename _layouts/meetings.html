<h2>Upcoming Meetings</h2>

<div class="post">
	<p>
		Our technical meetings are nearly always held the last Thursday of every month, from 7pm-9pm. Traditionally
		we are always an in-person only meeting. Due to COVID, we were forced to adopt virtual meetings as an alternative.
		As for which meetings will be in-person or virtual, usually you will need to check our Mastodon or ask on Discord.
		Sometimes the decision is made day of.
	</p>
    <p>Since in person meetings depend on city infection levels, our <a href="https://infosec.exchange/@AustinHackers">Mastodon</a> page may have more up-to-date information on meeting statuses.</p>
	<p>
		When physical meetings resume, the following is useful information:

	<p>
		To access this room enter through the front of Tramps and head straight towards the back. Either the huge
		sliding door will be open (you arrived early) or it will be closed (do not open it). To the left of the
		huge sliding door is a small door leading to the bathrooms. Through the door and down the hall on your
		right is the door to the meeting room. This is the only door you should use. DO NOT use the service
		entrance to the left of the bar. See the
		<a href="http://mistertramps.com/">Mister Tramps</a> site for details on the venue.
		Hereâ€™s a <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&geocode=&q=mister+tramps&aq=&sll=30.395835,-97.698202&sspn=0.012678,0.018432&ie=UTF8&hq=mister+tramps&hnear=&ll=30.3616,-97.717338&spn=0.012683,0.018432&z=16&iwloc=A">map</a>.
		The bistro is on the northbound side of 183-N, between Lamar and Burnet.
	</p>
	<p>
		Food and drinks will still be permissible at the meeting, provided you purchase said food and drinks
		from Mister Tramps. When you are not consuming food or drinks, appropriate masking is
		<strong>strongly encouraged</strong> while indoors.
	</p>
	<p>
		In-person attendees are <strong>required</strong> to be fully vaccinated against
		<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/index.html">COVID-19</a>,
