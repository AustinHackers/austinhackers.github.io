### Rules
There are essentially three basic rules of AHA.

* You must participate to remain a member.
* There is no recording or filming allowed.
* What happens at AHA, stays at AHA.
* Keep your talk under 10 mins*.

Participation is defined in the [about us]({{ site.aboutus }}) section. It is required to remain an active
member and attending meetings, remain on IRC, and the rest of our services.

We do not allow recording of audio, video or photography at our meetings. Much of our research is pre-con
and early demos of work that will be shown at larger conferences. Our presenters expect to be able to share
material with us in a safe manner that allows feedback and fostering of new ideas. You will be ejected from
the meeting location if you violate this rule.

Do not discuss presentations or conversations at AHA outside of the meeting, with a journalist, with your
boss, or with a representative of a relevant vendor. Any confirms leaks will result in a lifetime ban from
all future AHA meetings.

* We HATE long talks. The beauty of AHA is that if you don't like or don't know the content of a talk, wait 5-10
minutes for the next one. IF YOU PLAN TO SPEAK LONGER THAN 10 MINUTES you must notify the personal maintaining
the list at the BEGINNING of the meeting. You will be requested to speak last. If you go over, expect to be
heckled and interrupted until you stop talking.

If you must exceed 10 minutes, it better be damn worth it.
