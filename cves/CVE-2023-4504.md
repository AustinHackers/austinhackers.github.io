# CVE-2023-4504: OpenPrinting CUPS/libppd Postscript Parsing Heap Overflow

[AHA!] has discovered an issue with CUPS and libppd from OpenPrinting, and is publishing
this disclosure in accordance with AHA!'s standard [disclosure policy] today,
on Thursday, September 21, 2023. [CVE-2023-4504] has been assigned to this issue.

Any questions about this disclosure should be directed to
**cve@takeonme.org**.

# Executive Summary

Due to failure in validating the length provided by an attacker-crafted CUPS PPD file, CUPS version v2.5b1 and prior, by default, is susceptible to a heap-based buffer overflow, and possibly code execution. [CVE-2023-4504] appears to be an instance of [CWE-122], a heap-based buffer overflow.

# Technical Details

The `scan_ps` function in the CUPS codebase provides functionality that scans through a string looking for the next Postscript object. When iterating through a string which contains an open parenthesis and ends with a single backslash (0x5c) character, the code incorrectly iterates forward a character without properly checking the bounds of the string resulting in a 1 byte read beyond the allocated heap buffer. 

Snippet of the vulnerable code:

cups/cups/raster-interpret.c
```
1039 static _cups_ps_obj_t   *               /* O  - New object or NULL on EOF */
1040 scan_ps(_cups_ps_stack_t *st,           /* I  - Stack */
1041         char             **ptr)         /* IO - String pointer */
1042 {

1157         }
```

Line 1085 contains the case statement which provides the logic used to iterate through the given string.

On line 1091, the for loop within the case statement is used to iterate through each character after encountering an open paranthesis character (0x28), storing the pointer to the current character in `cur`.

On line 1111, the code checks if the current character is a backslash and finally, in line 1117, the character index is incremented without checking the length, now pointing to the null byte terminating the string. 

Upon the next iteration of the loop, on line 1094, the loop now begins iterating through unallocated memory resulting in undefined behaviour.

# Attacker Value

By providing this malformed PPD file, an attacker could compromise the machine running the affected software, either CUPS or another application that uses the libppd library. Once compromised, this can provide an attacker a unique, privileged position in the targeted network.
