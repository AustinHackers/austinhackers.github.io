I spoke about RTP audio injection, how the attack works, and then gave a
demo of some injection tools from researchers at SecureLogix that I've
improved upon over the past month or so. The updated tools will be
joint-released by myself and the SecureLogix folks alongside my talk at
EUSecWest, however the currently available manual tools can be found at
the links below.
