My talk was about using Non-HTTP attack vectors for XSS attacks against
the administrative interfaces of multiple networking devices. The DNS
and Telnet protocols were discussed and shown in examples. After
starting with some basic XSS, a persistent XSS attack that creates a
fully priviledged user is shown.

Due to the unpatched status of these bugs, slides will not be provided.
