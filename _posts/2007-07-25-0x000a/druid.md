I spoke briefly about the (mostly) finished RTP steganography tool that
I was brainstorming on a few meetings ago. I'll be releasing the tool at
DEFCON on August 4th which will be available at it's Sourceforge project
page. Slides from the full presentation will also be released at the
same time at the locations below.
