Snake discussed interesting ways to hack intranets through web-pages.
The web-pages allow users to request images from the internet for
uploading (for the purpose of customizing web-boards for instance).
Instead of pointing to images on the internet, the attacker points to
images in RFC1918 address space. More info here.
