In my talk, I explained one set of bugs patched by Microsoft this month.
Several gadgets included with Vista suffer from remote code execution
bugs due to the use of Internet Explorer running all gadget javascript
in the 'local' zone. After explaining the process of finding the bug
from the patches, I attempt to demonstrate the exploit. After several
disappointing mid-demo moments of non-successfulness, all the
appropriate attacker-side tools were up and running, and the damn thing
worked finally.
