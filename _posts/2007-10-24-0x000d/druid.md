This month I gave the presentation on context-keyed payload encoders
that I recently presented at ToorCon 9. I had originally intended to
only give the latter half of the presentation as an update to the talk I
gave a few meetings ago, however since the vast majority of attendees
were new I went ahead and gave the full presentation to catch them up on
what I was talking about.
