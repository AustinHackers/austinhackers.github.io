I gave the first in hopefully what will become a series of turbo talks
that I've named "Blast From the Past" over something novel, useful, or
notable from many many years ago. The one I gave at this meeting was a
very short overview of an exploitation framework that CAU designed and
implemented just under a decade ago (in 1997), drawing some comparisons
to HD's Metasploit Framework.
