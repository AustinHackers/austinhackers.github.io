I spoke about hacking the Nintendo Wii console's primary controller, the
Wii Remote (or Wiimote for short). The talk was essentially an overview
of the Wiimote hardware, it's BlueTooth HID interface, and a tool called
GlovePIE which can be used to script for the Wiimote and which abstracts
away all of the lower-layer details into a nice object-oriented
scripting language.
