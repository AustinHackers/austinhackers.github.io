I basically ranted about my frustration with managing Cisco routers and
switches. Specifically, the ridiculous multiitude of IOS builds,
determining which build works as an update to a particular router or
switch, the user unfriendly nature of the Cisco support website, the
fact that the Cisco support site requires a clear text login, and how I
simply resorted to building my own router using a Soekris box and Linux.
I'll throw my slides up later.
