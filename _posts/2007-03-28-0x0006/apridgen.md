I spoke for a few moments about the projects that I am currently (not
so) hard at work on:

1) Mobile Agents (presented about a few months ago): The code I had on
my laptop was broken because of some features I added, but next time I
should be able to give a demo. I tracked down and fixed all the bugs
this eveningâ€¦bummer though.

2) Mentioned some work I am doing with Pai-Mei. I have some basic
functions to explode and manipulate a static (string) disassembly dumps
after a pida analysis. I need to put together some glue code and logic,
and then I should be able to identify basic information and then comment
and report on it at a high level. Right now, everything is fairly
primitive though :-)
