I described a protocol and reference implementation I'm working on to
provide a full-duplex steganographic communications channel within the
payload of the RTP protocol. I won't be releasing the slide deck I used
as it is a work-in-progress for a full presentation covering the final
product which I will give at a later date. My goal was to solicit
feedback while I'm still in development.
