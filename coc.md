## Austin Hackers Association (AHA!) Code of Conduct

Welcome to AHA! If you’re here, you already know this isn’t your typical buttoned-up tech meetup. We swear, we heckle, and we’re all just here to have a great fucking time. But even in our chaotic little corner, we have some ground rules.

#### Roast the Ideas, Not the Person

>> Got a hot take? Bring it. Got a dumb take? Expect to hear about it. But keep it fun. Don’t be a dick to the person; they’re here to learn and blow off steam just like you.

#### No Creeps, No Bullies, No Exceptions

>> We don’t fuck around with harassment, discrimination, or any of that other crap. If you make someone feel uncomfortable based on who they are, you’re out. Full stop. Play nice or don’t play here.

#### Own Your Shit and Move On

>> We’re not saints, but we are accountable. If you mess up, just admit it and fix it. Don’t double down or play dumb. We’re all here to learn, so act like it.

#### Go Nuts, But Don’t Get Us Arrested

>> Bring your wildest energy and loudest voice—hell, we expect it. Just don’t cross that line where it turns into a legal nightmare. You know where the line is… we think.

### How we handle violations

We’re serious about creating a fun and inclusive space where everyone can feel safe being themselves. If these rules get broken, here’s how we deal with it:

#### Step One: A Quiet Word

>> For minor violations, you’ll get a direct heads-up from one of the organizers. They’ll let you know what’s up and how to keep it chill moving forward.

#### Step Two: Time-Out

>> For repeated or more serious issues, you might be asked to step away from the event/Discord for the night or longer. This isn’t middle school—we’ll treat you like an adult, but we’ll also hold you accountable.

#### Step Three: Bye Forever

>> Major violations (e.g., harassment, discrimination, breaking the “No Creeps, No Bullies” rule) mean you’re permanently out. No debate, no appeal, no re-entry.

#### Confidential Reporting

>> If you experience or witness something that doesn’t sit right, talk to an organizer in person or message us privately. We’ll handle it discreetly and follow up. No drama, no spotlight, just action.

### Mob Rule

We ALL hold ourselves to these same standards. If anyone messes up, call us out—we’ll own it and make it right. At the end of the day, the Mob is who rules AHA. What the masses decide is what happens.
