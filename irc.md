While traditionally the best way to communicate in AHA was the [mailing
list]({{ site.mailinglistpage }}), now the most common place to find us
is on IRC. We can be found on the [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) IRC
Network in the channel #AHA.

* Server: chat.freenode.net
* Channel: #AHA

There are no specific channel rules, but please do not ask stupid
questions like, "How do I hack X" or showing up to simply cause drama.
This is a good place to talk to speakers from past meetings about their
projects, or to look for feedback on your own talk.

## FAQ

Anything that deserves a longer conversation, planning, or feedback from
more members, should probably be taken to the [mailing list]({{ site.mailinglistpage }}).
