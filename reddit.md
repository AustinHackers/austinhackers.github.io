# {{ page.title }}

For those of you interested in a place to discuss topics in a more linear style and also
share your own work, code, slides, etc, we're now hosting a private subreddit at [r/AHA](https://reddit.com/r/AHA).
This is a private subreddit that will require a moderator to add your reddit account. The
idea behind making it private is merely one to limit scraping by things like Google and
random unintended users from stubbling across it and causing trouble.

* [AHA! Subreddit](https://reddit.com/r/AHA)

To gain access to the subreddit, simply send a message via reddit to the [moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/AHA&subject=Access%20to%20Subreddit).
It is strongly encouraged to identify yourself in this message if your username is not known or associated with the
name or handle you use at AHA!

Keep in mind that we still may not grant you access until you've identified yourself in
person at a meeting. We don't know everyone.
